          I am a solider trying to change my job to what I enjoy. I create
          websites with passion and simplicity. I regularly devote my free time
          to learning new things. I enjoy learning and expanding my knowledge.
          Besides, I actively practice sports (especially calisthenics) and
          enjoy playing computer games.
